## thank you for calling x y z customer support my name is jake how can i assist you today 
## hi jake i ordered a laptop last week and it was supposed to arrive two days ago but i haven't received it yet i need answers 
## i completely understand how frustrating this is and i sincerely apologize let me check your order details can you provide your order number 
## yes it's five six seven eight nine x y z 
## thank you i see that your order was shipped on january twenty fifth via fedex expected to arrive on january twenty ninth however there seems to be an unexpected delay with the carrier 
## that's unacceptable i needed this laptop for an urgent project i even paid extra for fast shipping 
## agent i completely understand your frustration let me escalate this with fedex and request priority delivery 
## additionally i'd like to offer a ten percent refund on your shipping fee for the inconvenience would that be acceptable 
## a refund is fine but when will i actually get my laptop 
## i see that fedex has already processed the package in their seattle facility 
## request an expedited delivery and based on previous cases you should receive it by tomorrow evening i'll also send a tracking link for real time updates 
## all right that sounds better but i wish i had been notified sooner you're absolutely right i'll raise this as feedback to improve our communication i truly appreciate your patience
